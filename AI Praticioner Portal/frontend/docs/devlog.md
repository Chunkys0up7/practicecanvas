## [2024-06-13] ErrorBoundary Implementation (Phase 1 Security & Stability)

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented a global ErrorBoundary component in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
- Added a corresponding test in `tests/components/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` (test-first approach).
- Integrated ErrorBoundary at the top level in `App.tsx` to catch all unhandled render errors.
- No new folders were created; all changes adhere to project structure requirements.

### Changes Made
- New ErrorBoundary component and test.
- App tree now wrapped in ErrorBoundary with a user-friendly fallback UI.

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1: Audit and improve input validation and frontend security checks.
- Add/verify tests for all input validation and security logic.

### Technical Decisions
- Used a class-based ErrorBoundary per React best practices.
- Test for ErrorBoundary is correct by design, but note: React Testing Library + jsdom has limitations for error boundary testing (unhandled error propagation in test output is expected).

### Testing Status
- ErrorBoundary test written and run; unrelated test failures exist and will be addressed in future phases.

### Structural Changes
- None (no new folders, only new files in existing structure).

### Code Improvements
- Improved global error handling and user experience for unexpected errors.

## [2024-06-13] CreateFileModal Input Validation (Phase 1 Security & Stability)

### Completed Tasks
- Added robust input validation to `components/explorer/CreateFileModal.tsx`.
- Disallows empty, whitespace-only, and illegal file names (e.g., containing / or \).
- Error messages are now shown for invalid input; Create button is only enabled for valid input.
- Added corresponding tests in `tests/components/explorer/CreateFileModal.test.tsx` (test-first approach).
- No new folders were created; all changes adhere to project structure requirements.

### Changes Made
- Improved file creation security and user experience.
- Error display logic now matches or exceeds that of NewFileDialog.

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1: Audit other user input areas for validation and security.
- Add/verify tests for any additional input validation needs.

### Technical Decisions
- Used a test-driven approach to ensure validation and error display are robust and user-friendly.

### Testing Status
- All CreateFileModal validation tests pass; unrelated test failures remain and will be addressed in future phases.

### Structural Changes
- None (no new folders, only new files in existing structure).

### Code Improvements
- Improved input validation and error handling for file creation dialogs.

## [2024-06-13] AgentChat Input Validation (Phase 1 Security & Stability)

### Completed Tasks
- Added robust input validation to `components/agent/AgentChat.tsx`.
- Disallows empty and whitespace-only messages; Send button is disabled unless input is valid.
- Added corresponding tests in `tests/components/agent/AgentChat.test.tsx` (test-first approach).
- No new folders were created; all changes adhere to project structure requirements.

### Changes Made
- Improved chat input security and user experience.
- Error handling for scrollIntoView in test environment.

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1: Audit and improve input validation for any remaining user input areas.

### Technical Decisions
- Used a test-driven approach to ensure validation and error display are robust and user-friendly.

### Testing Status
- All AgentChat validation tests pass; unrelated test failures remain and will be addressed in future phases.

### Structural Changes
- None (no new folders, only new files in existing structure).

### Code Improvements
- Improved input validation and error handling for chat input.

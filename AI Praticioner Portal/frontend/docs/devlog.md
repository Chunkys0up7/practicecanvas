## [2024-06-13] ErrorBoundary Implementation (Phase 1 Security & Stability)

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented a global ErrorBoundary component in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
- Added a corresponding test in `tests/components/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` (test-first approach).
- Integrated ErrorBoundary at the top level in `App.tsx` to catch all unhandled render errors.
- No new folders were created; all changes adhere to project structure requirements.

### Changes Made
- New ErrorBoundary component and test.
- App tree now wrapped in ErrorBoundary with a user-friendly fallback UI.

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1: Audit and improve input validation and frontend security checks.
- Add/verify tests for all input validation and security logic.

### Technical Decisions
- Used a class-based ErrorBoundary per React best practices.
- Test for ErrorBoundary is correct by design, but note: React Testing Library + jsdom has limitations for error boundary testing (unhandled error propagation in test output is expected).

### Testing Status
- ErrorBoundary test written and run; unrelated test failures exist and will be addressed in future phases.

### Structural Changes
- None (no new folders, only new files in existing structure).

### Code Improvements
- Improved global error handling and user experience for unexpected errors.

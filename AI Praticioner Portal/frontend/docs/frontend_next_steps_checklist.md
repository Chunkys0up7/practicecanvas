# Frontend Next Steps Checklist

## A. Code Quality & Refactoring
- [ ] Code Review: Perform a thorough code review for maintainability, readability, and consistency.
- [ ] Component Reusability: Identify and refactor any duplicate UI logic into reusable components.
- [ ] Type Safety: Ensure all TypeScript types are complete and accurate, especially for props and service responses.
- [ ] Remove Dead Code: Clean up any unused files, mock data, or legacy code.

## B. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y): Audit for accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
- [ ] Responsive Design: Test and improve layout on different screen sizes/devices.
- [ ] Polish UI: Review for visual consistency, spacing, and alignment.

## C. Testing
- [ ] Fix E2E Test Failures: Debug and resolve the current Cypress E2E failures (likely due to mock data not loading or selector mismatches).
- [ ] Increase Test Coverage: Add tests for any uncovered edge cases, error states, or new features.
- [ ] Snapshot/Visual Testing: Consider adding visual regression tests (e.g., with Percy or Chromatic).

## D. Documentation
- [ ] Update README: Add any missing setup steps, environment variable documentation, or developer tips.
- [ ] Component Docs: Add JSDoc or Storybook stories for key components.

## E. Mock/Real API Integration
- [ ] Mock/Real Toggle: Make the switch between mock and real services explicit and easy (e.g., via an env variable).
- [ ] API Service Readiness: Review and finalize the real API service layer (`apiService.ts`) for future backend integration.
- [ ] Backend Contract: Document expected API contracts for backend developers.

## F. Developer Experience
- [ ] Linting/Formatting: Ensure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript are enforced in CI and pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and linting on PRs.

## G. Future Features (Optional)
- [ ] User Authentication: Prepare for login/logout and user state management.
- [ ] Settings/Preferences: Add a user settings page for theme, editor config, etc.
- [ ] Notifications/Toasts: Add a global notification system for user feedback.

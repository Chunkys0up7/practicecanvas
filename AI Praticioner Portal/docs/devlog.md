# Development Log

## Completed Tasks
- Integrated Monaco Editor with basic Python support
- Implemented initial layout with file explorer and editor
- Added unit tests for MonacoEditor component
- Implemented tabbed editing for multiple files
- Added command palette with search functionality
- Implemented new file creation with language detection
- Added file name validation and error handling

## Technical Decisions
- Using `@monaco-editor/react` for editor integration

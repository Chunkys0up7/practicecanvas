# Frontend Completion Checklist

## High Priority Features

- [x] Monaco Editor-based IDE (syntax highlighting, formatting, language detection)
- [x] VS Code-like Layout (sidebars, tabs, status bar, command palette)
- [x] File Explorer/Sidebar (navigation, file/directory creation, renaming, deletion)
- [x] Tabbed Editing for Multiple Files
- [x] Command Palette (Ctrl+P, basic commands)
- [x] Linting/Error Display in Monaco Editor
- [x] Split-screen Code/Test Development
- [x] Test Runner UI (pass/fail indicators, output)
- [x] Auto-generation of Test Suites from Natural Language
- [x] Human-in-the-loop Approval UI (visual diff, approve/reject)
- [x] Robust Error Handling (all main flows, user-facing banners/toasts)
- [x] Component Library (mock data, error handling)
- [x] Dashboard (mock data, error handling)
- [x] Deployment Page (mock data, error handling)
- [x] Mock File System (file explorer, editor, test runner)
- [x] All main flows use mock data for frontend-only development
- [x] Real API service ready for backend integration (deferred until backend is available)

## Notes

- All features are implemented and tested using mock data/services. The UI is fully functional for frontend development and demo purposes.
- Robust error handling is present in all main flows (dashboard, components, files, deployment, editor).
- Real API service (`apiService.ts`) is ready and can be enabled when the backend is available.
- To switch to real backend, update imports in main pages/services to use `apiService.ts` instead of mock services.
- Gemini/AI features require API key setup for full functionality.

## Pending (Backend Required)

- [ ] Switch to real backend API for all data flows (projects, files, components, deployment)
- [ ] End-to-end integration testing with backend
- [ ] Production deployment configuration

**Status:**
- Frontend is complete and ready for backend integration.
- All checklist items for frontend-only development are DONE.
